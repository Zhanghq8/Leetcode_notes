## Question
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, `*`, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

# Example1:
```
Input: "3+2*2"
Output: 7
```
# Example2:
```
Input: " 3/2 "
Output: 1
```
# Example3:
```
Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
```

# Note:
- You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
- Do not use the eval built-in library function.
