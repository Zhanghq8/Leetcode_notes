## Question
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

# Note
- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

# Example1:
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1
```
# Example2:
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1```
