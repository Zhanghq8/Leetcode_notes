## Question
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

# Example1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```
# Example2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```
# Example:
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]	
```
# Note:
- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
- Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
