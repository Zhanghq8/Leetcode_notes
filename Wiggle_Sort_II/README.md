## Question

Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....

# Example1:
```
Input: nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4]
Output: One possible answer is [1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6].
```
# Example2:
```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: One possible answer is [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2].
```

# Note:
- You may assume all input has valid answer.

# Follow up:
- Can you do it in O(n) time and/or in-place with O(1) extra space?
