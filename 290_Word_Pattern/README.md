## Question
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.

# Example1:
```
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
```
# Example2:
```
Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
```
# Example3:
```
Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
```
# Example4:
```
Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false
```
# Note:
- You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters that may be separated by a single space.
